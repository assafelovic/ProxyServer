Methods added:


1. DELETE HTTP method (found in lines 210 and 326):
The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the Request-URI.
This method MAY be overridden by human intervention (or other means) on the origin server.
The client cannot be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action has been completed successfully.
However, the server SHOULD NOT indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible location.

A successful response returns 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing the status, 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted but the file requested to delete is the source default file (index.html) or 404 if the file does not exist.



2. PUT HTTP METHOD:
The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.
If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server.
If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.
If a new resource is created, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the 201 (Created) response.
If an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request.

If the resource could not be created or modified with the Request-URI, or the resource is the index.html file, an appropriate error response SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the problem.



Source codes added:


1. 201 Created Source Code.

2. 204 No Content Source Code.
